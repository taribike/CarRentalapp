   - If you get SSL certificate errors, try using HTTP instead: `http://localhost:5000`
   - Update the `base_url` environment variable

2. **Connection Refused**
   - Ensure the API server is running
   - Check if MongoDB is running on port 27017

3. **404 Not Found**
   - Verify the API server is running on the correct port
   - Check the `base_url` environment variable

4. **500 Internal Server Error**
   - Check the API server logs
   - Ensure MongoDB is accessible

### Payment Testing Notes
